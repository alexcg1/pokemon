# Pokemon Project

## Assumptions

* We have 7 days to plan and execute, with launch on children's day (1 June 2020)
* We have full resources of the $COMPANY team and organization as it stands on 25 May 2020 (i.e. like 4 people)
* We're working in the world of 2020 - i.e. coronavirus lockdown, no travel or in-person events
* We've already arranged a licensing agreement with rights-holders
* Because this is an interview task, little feedback will be given until the final plan is presented. This is in contrast to a real-world plan, where I would solicit feedback along the way
* Dataset is [Pokemon sprites from G1 to G5](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads)
  * Each Pokemon has two different sprites, but they are just recolors. They are only in one position

## Aim

* Attract developers to use $PRODUCT by doing a joint promotion with Pokemon
* We can attract:
  * Developers who like Pokemon themselves
  * Developers whose kids like Pokemon
  * Developers who have heard of Pokemon (ie everyone ever) and can see we're doing something cool 

## Plan

Organize an event to promote $PRODUCT in association with Pokemon. This event:

1. Is highly promotional in itself, by doing **Something Cool**(TM)
2. Leads to longer term promotion by acting as launch event for a larger venture

## Idea: Blindfold Pokemon Challenge

**TLDR:** Kids put on a blindfold and draw one of the Pokemon from the dataset and submit their pic. The one that gets the most accurate hit from $COMPANY is the winner

Yes, it's simple. But that also makes it easy to explain, fast to pull off, and limited additional infrastructure is needed. Given constraints, best to do something simple and achievable rather than something fancy and likely to fail

### Organizing

* $COMPANY and Pokemon company work together to choose 10 Pokemon from the dataset for the competition
* Create simple website for desktop and mobile for entrants to compete
* Children's day acts as the launch date for this project, *not* the day when judging is wrapped up, etc
  * Due to time constraints
  * Also because children's day is big. Launching then gets us the biggest audience. Better to have big audience at launch instead of big audience just for judging
* Content duration: see timefrmame spreadsheet

### Entering the Challenge

* Participants draw and color one of these Pokemon blindfolded (prevents peeking or tracing)
* Participant goes to our website (desktop or mobile), and:
  * Uploads their pic (with crop function, to ensure size consistency and centering)
  * Uploads the video of them drawing
  * Selects which Pokemon the pic is (click the sprite of that Pokemon)
  * Leaves their contact info
  * Agrees to the terms and conditions
* Participant shares their video and pic on Twitter, FB, TikTok, etc, with #blindfoldpokemon hashtag 
* Different categories per age range:
  * otherwise 16 year olds would kick the ass of 8 year olds
  * Could even have adult category for broader engagement

### Judging

* $COMPANY trains a model on dataset of those 10 selected Pokemon
* Drawings are gathered, processed, and each passed through $PRODUCT and compared with target dataset
* Highest K-score pic gets prize
* Booby prize for best out-take (encourages filming failures, which can be good for comedy value and memes. No-one wants to see only geniuses)

### Prizes

* Given timeframe we could fabricate a metal **trophy** from a 3D printed design on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/), like a [Pokeball](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=pokeball&type=things&sort=relevant), [Pikachu](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=pikachu&type=things&sort=relevant), or something like that.
* Not super-urgent since awarded at the end of the challenge
