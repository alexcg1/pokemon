## Pokemon Company

## Organizing and Communications

The above will be organised into teams to work on tasks:

| Team | Responsibility | Members |
| ---  | ---            | ---     |
| Engineering team  | Project website, machine learning flow       | Engineers |
| Creative team     | Graphic, video design, voiceover                | External talent, marketing contact at Pokemon   |
| Project team      | High-level project decisions and oversight      | Key team members from Pokemon and $COMPANY |

I'll lead and coordinate each group.

We'll use:

* Dedicated Slack groups - keeps comms in one place, reduces bottlenecks (e.g. if key point of contact in another timezone, that leads to lag)
* Shared folders/repos - for file storage. Preferably self-hosted for reliability/accessibility (some countries block some services)
* Daily standups over Zoom - for the engineers we can go with agile methodology or similar. For creative and project teams, members may not be familiar, so stick to simple stand-up meetings over
