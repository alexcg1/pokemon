# Less Viable Ideas

Due to time constraints, dataset limitations, etc, the following are less feasible or downright impossible for children's day 2020

For below ideas, we would need to either:

* train model on less restricted dataset (e.g. Pokemon in more poses, positions, backgrounds), or
* pre-process input data for search (this one seems easier, especially with pretrained models that already turn ppl into anime characters or remove backgrounds)

For below ideas, winner is determined by feeding each entry image in turn into $PRODUCT and seeing which gets hit with highest probability

### Expanding Draw-a-picachu

These are just thoughts, but don't have timeframe to implement

* Release an app for iOS and Android to allow blind drawing and instant compare to pokemon database so entrants can practice and submit drawings

### Semi Viable

#### Pokecosplay

* Prize for user who can create and model best [shitty cosplay] that resembles a still from the Pokemon cartoon.
* Requires input image preprocessing

#### Real Life Pokemon

* Take pictures of things in real life that look like Pokemon
* Requires input image preprocessing

#### Which Pokemon are you?

* Take a pic of yourself
* Match that via neural search to closest Pokemon look-alike
* Requires input image preprocessing

### Not Viable

Given timeframe, company size, pandemic, dataset limitations, we can't really pull these off within a week

#### Pokehack

Hackathon. Impossible to pull off with just a week notice, but could be a follow-up event

### Not thought out yet

These are more concepts and brainstorming, rather than actual ideas

* Pokemon Go integration
* Pokemon cards

### Prizes

#### Real Life Pokedex

Not viable in short term!

* $PRODUCT running on a Rasp Pi in a custom shell
* Can do search for Pokemon via text or sketched neural search and display wikipedia style entry and matching pics

#### Create your own pokemon

Winner gets to design Pokemon for next game. This seems like a huge ask and not sure we could get agreement from stakeholders
