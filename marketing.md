# Marketing

## Assumptions

* Pokemon company are a marketing partner and push the message out via their usual channels
* Since we have limited manpower and Pokemon company have one of the world's top marketing teams (I mean, who hasn't heard of Pokemon?), plan for most messaging to go through their channels

## Branding

* Joint branding with Pokemon company
* $COMPANY itself also needs to be branded in a child-friendly way, to explain *how* judging technically works:
  * $COMPANYPup - a robotic puppy. Dogs like to fetch things, just like a search engine. And she's a puppy so her capabilities are limited, not like a fully-grown dog. And she's robotic, so we can explain away difficult questions. And she's cute, so child-friendly. And tied to $COMPANY specifically, so can re-use for later campaigns that aren't linked to Pokemon.
  * Animate $COMPANYPup to show how it all works. Include this in promotional videos, social media, website
  * Use same designer as $COMPANY 101 for consistency and speed
  * Just simple like animated gif

### Slogans

* Don't peek-a-chu!
* Draw-a-pic-a-chu!

## Website

* Described in the main plan document

## Social Media

* Create social media accounts for @$COMPANYpup to promote this. Using @$COMPANYpup allows us to tailor message for kids, and re-use for non-Pokemon projects
* Create #blindfoldpokemon hashtag
* Assume website created and launched before we do following
* Contact ML, DL, search, tech accounts and sites to get the word out
* Hit up [Pokemon subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/pokemon) and forums, post there
* Monitor our @$COMPANYpup account and respond in the right "voice" (i.e. not the voice we would use for highly technical ML practitioners). Also plenty of Pokemon memes!
* Share incoming hashtagged content via our channels
* Create montages of the videos and share those too

## Events

Anything in-person is out of the question, so all will be virtual

* Kids Q+A: Collect a list of questions, answer them in a video (not live, because that would mean limited ourselves to a few timezones and thus a few languages. Better to collect the questions, translate, think about answers, then put in video)
* Technical Q+A: For developers - can do it live since bed times and language barriers less of a problem for adult devs.
* Judging: Live zoom event with translation. Get top 50(?) participants, "award" trophy to winners. Make it kid-friendly
