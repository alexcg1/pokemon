# Marketing

## Assumptions

* Pokemon company are a marketing partner and push the message out via their usual channels
* Since we have limited manpower and Pokemon company have one of the world's top marketing teams (I mean, who hasn't heard of Pokemon?), plan for most messaging to go through their channels

## Branding

* Joint branding with Pokemon company
* $COMPANY itself also needs to be branded in a child-friendly way, to explain *how* judging technically works:
  * $COMPANYPup - a robotic puppy. Dogs like to fetch things, just like a search engine. And she's a puppy so her capabilities are limited, not like a fully-grown dog. And she's robotic, so we can explain away difficult questions. And she's cute, so child-friendly. And tied to $COMPANY specifically, so can re-use for later campaigns that aren't linked to Pokemon.
  * Animate $COMPANYPup to show how it all works. Include this in promotional videos, social media, website
  * Use same designer as $COMPANY 101 for consistency and speed
  * Just simple like animated gif

### Slogans

* Don't peek-a-chu!
* Draw-a-pic-a-chu!

## Marketing Channels

We are appealing to different audiences, so need to tailor marketing accordingly:

* Kids
* Parents
* Developers (in general)
* Developers (search/ML)

Kids and parents will only really be interested in the Pokemon aspect, and not care about the tech behind it. The reverse is true for developers. For this reason, suggest Pokemon company take the lead for kids and parents while we focus our efforts on developers.

### Developer Channels

* User submitted news sites - Hacker News, Lobste.rs, etc
* Tech blogs and sites
* Medium
* Social media - Twitter, LinkedIn
* Podcasts/Youtube interviews - difficult given timeframe
* Youtube videos
* Reddit AMA
* Webinar

### Developer Content

We use Pokemon as a hook to get developers interested, then reel them in with how cool our tech is. For that reason we can put a thin veneer of Pokemon sauce on the below, but keep the meat neural search flavored.

* Technical blog posts that explain our Pokemon project and how it works
* Webinars to go into technical aspects
* Existing tutorials, resources
* Github repo so they can reproduce our project website and backend for themselves (minus any Pokemon branding because legal reasons)

## Website

* Introduce project
* Project blog - kid facing
* Links to social media accounts and videos
* Allow user sign up via social media or email (legal issue: some countries make it illegal to collect data from kids >13)
* User uploads photo and video from phone. Photo is cropped by user on upload
* User agrees to terms and conditions and enters challenge

On the backend:

* Uploaded image is processed as needed to be fed into neural net (either as they come in, or in batch later)

## Social Media

* Create social media accounts for @$COMPANYpup to promote this. Using @$COMPANYpup allows us to tailor message for kids, and re-use for non-Pokemon projects
* Create #blindfoldpokemon hashtag
* Assume website created and launched before we do following
* Contact ML, DL, search, tech accounts and sites to get the word out
* Hit up [Pokemon subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/pokemon) and forums, post there
* Monitor our @$COMPANYpup account and respond in the right "voice" (i.e. not the voice we would use for highly technical ML practitioners). Also plenty of Pokemon memes!
* Share incoming hashtagged content via our channels
* Create montages of the videos and share those too

## Events

Anything in-person is out of the question, so all will be virtual

* Kids Q+A: Collect a list of questions, answer them in a video (not live, because that would mean limited ourselves to a few timezones and thus a few languages. Better to collect the questions, translate, think about answers, then put in video)
* Technical Q+A: For developers - can do it live since bed times and language barriers less of a problem for adult devs.
* Judging: Live zoom event with translation. Get top 50(?) participants, "award" trophy to winners. Make it kid-friendly
## Misc

## Video

A 2 minute introduction video explaining what the challenge is and how to take part

* Incorporate $COMPANYpup to explain and catch eye
* Feature footage from Pokemon cartoon if possible
* Create animation to show user flow and how to get involved

Since time is of the essence:

* Use stock footage where possible, instead of creating new footage

### Video brainstorm

* Pokemon trying to draw each other blindfolded, but $UNTRUSTWORTHY_POKEMON is peeking. Pikachu electrocutes them. Don't PEEK-A-CHU!
* Can we integrate with "shocked pikachu" meme?
