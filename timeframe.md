## Timeframe

## Assumptions

* We already have agreement from key stakeholders that this is a good idea. Otherwise back-and-forward over zoom and dealing with legal dept would take more time than we have.
* I will be the main lead on this project, and have limited access to other manpower for the $COMPANY side of things. Pokemon on the other hand, have lots of manpower and resources, but don't care so much about promotion the $COMPANY side of things or working on logistics.
* Launch of the contest is children's day. Judging comes a month later (for example)
* In real life, getting agreement over video scripts, which voiceover talent to use, etc, would take forever if we're working with a huge company like Pokemon. I've omitted the "get agreement and feedback from stakeholders" from many of the steps, since that would take forever. Instead I'm focusing on what *we* can do ourselves
* There's a reasonable budget for advertising, voiceover/video talent, etc

I'm taking full account of Murphy's and Hofstadter's Laws, and being deliberately pessimistic. Things will go wrong!

## Things Done in Advance

* $COMPANY has already worked with video producers and graphic designers, so has an existing pool and rough idea of price/duration
* $COMPANY knows it wants to do *something* for children's day, even if it doesn't yet know what. Therefore it's already contacted media outlets, etc for advertising rates
* $COMPANY already has media partners and contacts to promote their ML/search projects

#### Day 1

* Confirm marketing with team and stakeholders - video script, visuals
* Meeting with Pokemon company marketing team - what existing efforts can we leverage for promotion?
* Contact large existing children's day events and media - find out sponsorship costs and arrange shout outs and coverage for launch
* Brief video creator on what we need - they should give us quote by end of day and start brainstorming visuals
* Get quotes from voice-over talent for relevant languages for 2 minute video (assume English and Chinese only for now, bc constraints)
* Check stock footage we can use for video - someone being blindfolded, a hand drawing. No time to film new footage
* Finalize 2 minute video script that demonstrates and explains the challenge
* Agree quotes, send script to video producer, voiceover talent

#### Day 2

* Work with graphic designer on visuals and relay to video creator
* Finesse script with voiceover team
