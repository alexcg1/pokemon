# Assumptions, etc

Some things shouldn't really need to be said. But I have to assume them, and it helps to write them down. They're here. It's very likely we're all thinking along the same lines anyway, but I always find it good to write down my assumptions just to be better aware. And to mentally prepare for surprises further down the road.

Hopefully you won't be surprised by the below...

## Here we go...

This is not a final repo. It will contain half-baked ideas, swearing, and irrelevance. It's meant:

* As a work in progress
* To show my thought process
* To gather feedback (if anyone wants to give it - no obligation)
* To encourage a spirit of openness and transparency

## Feedback?

Feel free to make a pull request or file an issue!

## Assumptions

I assume some of the below shouldn't *really* need to be stated. But assuming makes an ass out of u and me, so I try to be comprehensive.

* We have 7 days to plan and execute, with launch on children's day (1 June 2020)
* We have full resources of the $COMPANY team and organization as it stands on 25 May 2020 (i.e. like 4 people)
* We're working in the world of 2020 - i.e. coronavirus lockdown, no travel or in-person events
* We've already arranged a licensing agreement with rights-holders, and we've got agreement on the broad strokes of the plan below. The alternative takes more than one week and is not viable.
* Because this is an interview task, little feedback will be given until the final plan is presented. This is in contrast to a real-world plan, where I would solicit feedback along the way
* Dataset is [Pokemon sprites from G1 to G5](https://veekun.com/dex/downloads)
  * Each Pokemon has two different sprites, but they are just recolors. They are only in one position
* This isn't actually going to roll out - even onboarding me would take longer than 1 week, let alone rolling out the plan below (Yes, this should go without saying. But I have stories to tell...)
