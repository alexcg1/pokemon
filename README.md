# Pokemon Braindump

This is not a final repo. It will contain half-baked ideas, swearing, and irrelevance. It's meant:

* As a work in progress
* To show my thought process
* To gather feedback (if anyone wants to give it - no obligation)
* To encourage a spirit of openness and transparency

Once my thoughts are complete I'll create a new file with my final thoughts and link to it from this README. In the meantime, feel free to check [braindump.md]. Or don't. Up to you!

## Why the $STUFF?

Since this is a public repo and nothing is official, I'm using $COMPANY and $PRODUCT in place of real names.

## Feedback?

Feel free to make a pull request or file an issue!
