## Why the $STUFF?

Since this is a public repo and nothing is official, I'm using $COMPANY and $PRODUCT in place of real names.

## Why only use 10 Pokemon in the contest?

Because some Pokemon are easier to draw than others, so it would skew the results if some people chose to draw [easy ones](http://qtoptens.com/top-10-easiest-pokemon-to-draw/) and some people chose [difficult ones](https://qtoptens.com/hardest-pokemon-to-draw/).
